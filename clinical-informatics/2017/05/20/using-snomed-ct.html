  <p><em>Update 2021</em>: You can find the latest version of my SNOMED CT library and microservice: <a href="https://github.com/wardle/hermes">hermes</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think that many clinicians have made some fundamental incorrect conclusions about the use of SNOMED CT in clinical practice. In particular, as SNOMED CT is touted as a replacement for Read codes, widely used in general practice in the UK, it is easy to conclude that SNOMED CT adds complexity and redundant codes without adding any other value.</p>

<p>I have written a short introduction on SNOMED CT in my <a href="/cis-design/2017/05/02/data-standards.html">data standards blog post</a>.</p>

<p>I would like you to understand and appreciate the benefit of the structure of SNOMED CT. To do this, I’m going to give a simple example of how we can leverage the structures built into SNOMED CT to create something useful.</p>

<h1 id="snomed-ct-structure">SNOMED CT structure</h1>

<p>Fundamentally, SNOMED-CT is broken down into three entities - “Concepts”, “Descriptions” and “Relationships”. A concept represents a concept, which might be a clinical diagnosis, an occupation, a pharmaceutical product or anything else really. Concepts may be simple “multiple sclerosis” or represent compound terms “family history of multiple sclerosis”. Each concept has a number of “Descriptions”, one of which is the preferred term for that language and the others synonyms for that term.</p>

<p>It is in the “Relationships” that I shall focus today. Relationships link concepts in a directional manner. However, the type of relationship is also a concept. I have shown this diagrammatically:</p>

<p><img src="/images/snomed-relationship-structure.png" alt="Snomed Relationship Structure" /></p>

<p>This means that multiple sclerosis IS-A type of demyelinating disease.</p>

<p>Now there are many practical uses of such a structure. One simple use is to understand the types of patients who present to your emergency department. You can iterate through the episodes of care, asking SNOMED-CT to tell you whether the final diagnosis was, for example, a type of respiratory illness.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the utility of the relationship structure within SNOMED CT, I would like to introduce the solution to a new problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can we allow free-text searching of unstructured clinical documents for specific diagnoses, including synonyms of that diagnosis?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what I want to do is allow the user to type, say “MI” and return documents that contain that concept. The simple option is to free-text search for “MI” but that won’t catch documents containing the text “myocardial infarction” or “heart attack”. Can we use the relationships within SNOMED CT to do this?</p>

<p>Yes you can, and I implemented this a few years ago.</p>

<p>The solution is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Search for synonyms matching the user entered term (e.g. “MI”). This should return diagnostic concepts matching myocardial infarction but also mitral valve incompetence.</li>
  <li>For each synonym, find the concept. For each concept, optionally also find concepts that are equivalent “child” concepts, recursively walking the IS-A relationship tree.</li>
  <li>For each concept, return all of the descriptions.</li>
</ol>

<p>An example can be found here, hitting a live SNOMED CT REST terminology server.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://msdata.org.uk:8080/snomedct/synonyms?s=mi&amp;root=64572001&amp;fsn=false&amp;inactive=false">http://msdata.org.uk:8080/snomedct/synonyms?s=mi&amp;root=64572001&amp;fsn=false&amp;inactive=false</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should end up with JSON with your results:</p>
