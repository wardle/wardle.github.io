&lt;p&gt;At the end of that talk (and post), I touched on the importance of building &lt;em&gt;capability&lt;/em&gt; : in data and the software that use those data - to deliver the outcomes we want in health and care. But what does that mean? What are the capabilities that we need to build, specifically?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our capabilities to record, view, manipulate and infer from &lt;em&gt;meaningful data&lt;/em&gt; - for direct care, for managing our services and for research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;depend upon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our capabilities to continually deliver safe, sustainable and secure software at pace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and we can look to the characteristics of the highest-performing technology teams to understand that these depend upon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;small, empowered, cross-functional (multi-disciplinary) teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;appropriate modularisation, with well-defined contractual (standards-based) interfaces between those modules&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fast feedback via automated testing and telemetry, monitoring and logging&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fast feedback from users with iterative, agile working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and understand, therefore, there is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mutual dependency between architecture, governance and standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because our capabilities are determined by our teams and how they can work effectively, and that means building an architecture that breaks down our problems into solvable chunks, making sure that governance is streamlined and effective so that there are clear lines of responsibility and defining the interactions between teams and the products for which they are responsible via open published standards as one part of the contractual obligations between those teams and products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;building-products-delivering-outcomes--choose-team-first-boundaries&quot;&gt;Building products delivering outcomes : “Choose team-first boundaries”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly, our architecture and governance are mutually-dependent with &lt;em&gt;technical standards&lt;/em&gt; as an integral part of the wider contracts between our modules and consequently, between our teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes little sense to govern programmes of work without respecting architectural boundaries; indeed, I would argue that many of the issues facing health and care services in Wales are as a result of ignoring this issue - such as thinking that it is appropriate to govern projects relating to patients and their interactions with services separately to projects relating to professionals, when in fact both &lt;em&gt;programmes&lt;/em&gt; of work share many core building blocks, such as citizen identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead need to recognise the importance of constructing &lt;em&gt;empowered teams&lt;/em&gt; to help us solve the problems we face and organise those teams into specific programmes of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mantra must surely be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;long-lived products within dynamic flexible programmes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Flow is difficult to achieve when each team depends on a complicated web of interactions with many other teams. For a fast flow of change to software systems, we need to remove hand-offs and align most teams to the main streams of change within the organization. However, many organizations experience huge problems with the responsibility boundaries assigned to teams. Typically, little thought is given to the viability of the boundaries for teams, resulting in a lack of ownership, disengagement, and a glacially slow rate of delivery.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Skelton, Matthew. Team Topologies (Kindle Locations 2147-2151). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we find the &lt;em&gt;fracture planes&lt;/em&gt; within our truly complex and heterogeneous systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A fracture plane is a natural seam in the software system that allows the system to be split easily into two or more parts. This splitting of software is particularly useful with monolithic software. The word monolith itself comes from Greek, meaning “single stone.” Traditional stonemasons hit stones at particular angles to split the rocks in clean segments, taking advantage of their natural fracture planes. We can look for similar fracture planes in software to find the natural split points that lead to software boundaries.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Skelton, Matthew. Team Topologies (Kindle Locations 2226-2227). IT Revolution Press. Kindle Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often, software architecture and system design occurs as a consequence of organisational or management structures, rather than stepping back and truly understanding the problem domain and how to carve it up into manageable chunks. You need to understand Conway’s Law, and the reverse Conway’s manoevre - and place the patient foremost in the design and architecture of your systems.&lt;/p&gt;

It was, as far as I am aware, the first implementation of SNOMED CT in a live clinical system. Most users have never known that SNOMED is its &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt;, and most think it is a bespoke ‘database’ for their use, because
I built multiple subject and specialty-specific “prisms” through which to see, what is essentially,
a single record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no better iterative fast feedback loop than being a user as well as a developer. It is difficult to know what works and what doesn’t work without an exploratory phase of design and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That software now supports the care of thousands of patients across Wales, over 126000 lines of code and on today’s estimates would cost $6 million to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as with any large software application, it’s starting to become more difficult to make changes. Early design decisions accelerated progress but are unduly limiting now. Early assumptions about how and where the application might be used are now proven wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such issues are common in all software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In NHS Wales, we have made amazing progress on some core national services solving difficult problems; we now have services for shared clinical documents, investigation results such as laboratory and radiology as well as a national staff directory and an enterprise master patient index providing a single cross-organisation view of patient identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the clinical application that staff use to access data in those services - Welsh Clinical Portal - will never be an electronic patient record. Early design decisions have bound it tightly to the local patient administrative system in each organisation and tight-coupling means that changes are difficult to make, and some health boards have requests for change that have waited years to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time we modernised the way we think about and develop health and care technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways of doing that is to recognise the benefits of modularisation, in which we break apart the problems we face to make them easier to solve and recompose those modules in interesting ways in order to solve problems for professionals and patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how and when to modularise requires significant technical and domain knowledge taking into account existing legacy services and the commercial market. We can use open technical standards to decouple those components. This is one way that we can pay down some of the technical debt built up over years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NHS Wales Informatics Service is being transformed into a new statutory body on 1st April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the ideal opportunity for it to become the digital platform on which we build a seamless, effective and safe health and care service for Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can and should be a provider of national shared services - much like Amazon has “Amazon Web Services” - with small, long-lived teams of experts providing a range of data and software services as well as support for provider organisations to make use of those services to improve their services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its mission cannot simply be “driving change” in the health service - there’s plenty of evidence that health boards are desperate to improve services using digital technology - it must be focusing on the work that can and should be shared across health and care in Wales - and working to &lt;em&gt;enable&lt;/em&gt; change by the provision of a suite of &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; data and computing services.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s taught me a great deal about how to recognise how to modularise and decouple different data and software components. It’s been running since 2009 and is in live use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a large project, and I can’t conceive of everything in one go, so even though I’m the only developer, adopting an architecture that enables modularity, adaptability and flexibility is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important aspect of my work is being able to compose individual building blocks together to solve problems, and to do that in a declarative, rules-based way. This means I can build solutions have them deployed and working in live clinical environments in less than a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most users think that the software is designed for them, and in a way it is. People refer to it as the “MS database” or the “referrals database” or the “Parkinson’s database” or the “MND database” but each is simply a prism through which to view a single digital patient record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the point, it’s quite easy to see the common foundational services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patient identity - lookup arbitrary identifiers such as any Welsh hospital identifier or NHS number or search (Google-like) by name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Staff identity and authentication - including lookup and email via the NHS Wales active directory service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finely-grained access control by the runtime registration of both patients and users to clinical services, teams and research projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tracking episodes of care and configurable encounters and data-collection forms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clinical terminology, value set management and organisational data services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Document creation and publication services, to create documents from data and publish those in local and national document management services such as Cardiff clinical portal and Welsh Clinical Portal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these building blocks, let’s build a neuro-rehabilitation database. I’m going to live blog this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;neuro-rehabilitation&quot;&gt;Neuro-rehabilitation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I designed the system, I recognised I’d need to make it easy to change the things that would change. Registering a new logical service or research project had to be easy and involve no software code. In fact, I wanted to ensure that I could configure lots of things at runtime, and I made SNOMED CT the lingua franca. If I need to write code, I wanted to make it as modular as possible and ensure that first changes didn’t affect what was already working and second, that I didn’t have to make changes anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neuro-rehabilitation team wanted to track a cohort of patients and make assessments about their rehabilitation need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can create a new service using my administration portal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/create-project.png&quot; alt=&quot;Create Project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can configure a project either as a clinical service or a research project. These have different semantics but all are organised in a hierarchical fashion so that properties are inherited from parent projects, and that users and patients are linked to services and projects via registration or episodes of care, and that means when you as a user search for John Smith, you’ll only get patients known to one of your registered services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/no-permission.png&quot; alt=&quot;No Permission&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a service or project, I can configure common SNOMED concepts so that drop-downs and picklists and autocompletion boxes get configured based on who you are and who you are seeing. This means users feel as if the system is designed for them, even if really it’s just simple configuration. I configure the specialty using SNOMED-CT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/choose-common-concepts.png&quot; alt=&quot;Choose Common Concepts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted users to be able to manage their own services, so all projects have per-project security permissions. This means I don’t need to be involved in registering users, and all “power users” need to do is type in a username and the software fetches their details from the national directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/choose-users.png&quot; alt=&quot;Choose Users&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each service can have different types of encounter. This is usually dependent on the service or project at hand, so is very customisable. Here I’ve simply created three for now, ‘correspondence’, ‘inpatient review’, and ‘telephone call’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/configure-encounters.png&quot; alt=&quot;Configure Encounters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for each, I configure some common forms. Users can manually record others, but this streamlines the process for them. Each encounter can be associated with fetching lists from external systems such as PAS making it useful for clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/configure-an-encounter.png&quot; alt=&quot;Configure An Encounter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I add a medication review (this used dm+d to record medications and changes to medications), a procedure form (useful for recording stuff done), a botulinum toxin form (a specialised procedure form), a MOCA (a cognitive test), and a rehabilitation assessment form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/configure-forms.png&quot; alt=&quot;Configure Forms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data collection forms are linked to encounters, which are linked to episodes, which are linked to patients. Each episode is linked to a project or service, and each project or service has a list of registered users. It’s quite straightforward to see how I implement finely-grained information governance using this model. Each user thinks the system is designed for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the rehabilitation assessment form. Its contents are automatically populated from information already in the electronic record, but users can make changes and then save. Diagnoses are recorded using SNOMED CT so later we can stratify our patient group by category of injury for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/configure-rehab-form.png&quot; alt=&quot;Configure Rehab Form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can add arbitrary validation so that we help users enter the right information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/rehab-assessment-outcome.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rehab Assessment Outcome&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have a “botulinum toxin database”, so I can simply re-use that form for this service. Some rehabilitation patients need injections of botulinum for spasticity or jaw problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/botulinum-toxin-form.png&quot; alt=&quot;Botulinum Toxin Form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these data are coded using SNOMED CT, even when you’re simply clicking on a diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lots of pre-built forms and it can take between 5 minutes and an hour or so to build a new one, depending on complexity. So other modules don’t have to understand the data within each form, forms generate SNOMED CT artefacts that can be used to dynamically configure the user interface depending on need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/list-forms.png&quot; alt=&quot;List Forms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each project or service can send clinical documents to other document repositories. I configure a “report” using a PDF template that will watermark the generated document. The document is generated from data. It’s a shame but none of the receiving document repositories can yet understand the structured information encoded with these documents, but accept only a PDF and a small amount of non-standard metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/configure-reports.png&quot; alt=&quot;Configure Reports&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once configured, users can create reports from their encounters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/publish-report.png&quot; alt=&quot;Publish Report&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;understanding-the-neuro-rehab-service&quot;&gt;Understanding the neuro-rehab service&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we have those data, we can slice and dice in order to help users understand their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In neurorehabilitation, the team want to understand who is in their active cohort, and understand those patients who need further review, as well as identify those ready for transfer. I can configure a “home page” for each service to provide a flexible modular system to show the right information at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what it looks like for neuro-rehabilitation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/neurorehab/understand-and-improve-data.png&quot; alt=&quot;Understand And Improve Data&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only do the team get to see who is in the cohort without a current assessment, but also stratify based on location and status, the screen updating as different criteria are chosen.  If the team want even greater flexibility, they can download a spreadsheet of data, by default with patient identifiable information removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This took just about six hours to go from inception to deployment, mainly because I’m able to simply stitch together foundational components to solve specific problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written previously about health and care central reporting requirements, and that such data returns are helpful and important but must be regarded as simply one ‘prism’ through which to ‘see’ a patient record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s good to see a specific example, so have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/documents/742/Site%20Specific%20Cancer%20Reporting%20July%202.pdf&quot;&gt;NHS Wales breast cancer reporting requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cancer-reporting.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cancer Reporting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dataset is a summary of the important aspects of breast cancer care and is vital for planning and improving services. It should also be used to &lt;em&gt;inform&lt;/em&gt; operational data collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s important that those requirements don’t dictate &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; that collection should be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That link reflects version 4.1 of the reporting requirements; requirements change and any digital systems supporting those reporting requirements needs to be able to adapt and flex accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;rectangles-and-projections&quot;&gt;Rectangles and projections&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But can we use central reporting requirements to design our clinical information systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many central data reporting requirements want data to be representing in &lt;em&gt;rectangles&lt;/em&gt;. That’s a bit like looking at patient data through the prism of a spreadsheet, such as Microsoft Excel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not dissimilar to cartography where a map projection takes the richness, splendour and complexity of a globe’s surface and projects it onto a two-dimensional surface for your atlas. In cartography, multiple projections are available that suit different purposes, each compromising the original information in some way. Each of those representations also create their own value -  a two-dimensional map can be printed or shown on your flat screen - they are useful representations, but they’re not the &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how our health and care data will be used by policy-makers is critical in designing compelling clinical information systems, but we need operational, day-to-day clinical data to solve &lt;em&gt;multiple purposes&lt;/em&gt; - direct care, management / policy and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;data-entry-weve-got-things-backwards&quot;&gt;Data-entry; we’ve got things backwards!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, to meet the demands of central data reporting, it is commonly the case, even in 2020, that data-entry, whether for cancer or for conditions such as stroke, is done after-the-event by someone whose job it is to collect the data and complete the returns. It’s retrospective, labour-intensive and error prone. It’s often the same for research; a separate methodology rather than a difference of acuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the data is not entered as a function of the process of care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it should be clear from the reporting requirements that most of the required information can and should actually be sourced from operational systems, if only one could build adaptable systems that prioritise meaningful data and can be stitched together and used as a source of meaningful information from which the right information can be plucked in order to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can we make data a function of the process of care?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;funnels-the-opportunity-of-decision-points&quot;&gt;Funnels: the opportunity of decision-points&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting is an opportunity for the aggregation, validation and input of decision-critical information. It’s easy to see the MDT as a funnel, and this doesn’t only apply to cancer, but any complex decision making such as epilepsy surgery or neurovascular disease in which multiple facets of information need to be understood by a multi-disciplinary team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/info-in-action-out.png&quot; alt=&quot;Info In Action Out&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the MDT is a microcosm of all clinical encounters, even when there’s only one professional involved. The funnel model is applicable to all clinical encounters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each clinical encounter is an opportunity to bring together disparate information, synthesise, formulate and plan. We need to not only capture that process but build technology that can make it as effective as possible. That means supporting both ends of the funnel - making the right information at the right time and supporting clinical synthesis and the ongoing orchestration and coordination of clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;on-data-and-decisions&quot;&gt;On data and decisions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with data in health and care is that there is no such thing as a single source of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This manifests even for what might be perceived as simple such as a patient’s address. Is that address the address for correspondence, the address of the parent, the term-time address or the address from which the patient moved from last year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s even more difficult for clinical data. Terms such as ‘diagnosis’ might not sound difficult but are fundamentally defined by &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;. A diagnosis of angina made by me is very different to that made by a cardiologist! Even our diagnostic tests are imperfect measures of the ‘truth’ with false positives and false negatives and repeated tests that give different results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the diagnostic process isn’t what might be imagined. We don’t record what we find and then work out the most likely diagnosis. We do it in reverse! The diagnosis informs what information we collect and how we examine! It’s iterative and internally correlated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even prescribing information is imperfect. Did the patient actually take that drug at all? Sometimes not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And look at how much information we might have. Is that step-count data, or home blood pressure monitoring data useful for informing our decisions? What tools do we have to make sense of burgeoning information from multiple sources? We can be overwhelmed with too much information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s much better to see clinical data for what it is and use it appropriately - we’re looking at the truth through the corner of our eyes, our data an imperfect imprint of the truth. We’re creating &lt;em&gt;models&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there’s uncertainty surrounding all of our decisions, and our data can help to reduce that uncertainty. Usually that’s by bringing different sources of information together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;information-at-the-right-time&quot;&gt;Information at the right time&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need software and systems driven by &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means a digital health and care patient record is much more that a flat list of documents with little or no accurate metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we shouldn’t ignore documents either. They have some important positive characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They can and should carry their own context; they can (usually) be read standalone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They reflect a snapshot of ‘state’ and thinking at a time-point&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are immutable, so don’t change after the event - if a change is needed a new document should be issued.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They support processes of care - because while they also a type of record, they &lt;em&gt;move around&lt;/em&gt; and so can be used to activate different workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that documents &lt;em&gt;move around&lt;/em&gt; is really important. They are a driver of much &lt;em&gt;tacit&lt;/em&gt; process and workflow. We have many unstated assumptions in health and care and one of our jobs is to understand their existence and their importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s better to see documents are the artefacts of care. Just like data for central reporting, we have things back to front and should be generating our documents and cascading workflow from our processes of care, and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medical record isn’t a simple record of what happened but a tool that helps us formulate, plan, communicate and deliver care. It’s a tool. “You’re a victim of it or a triumph because of it. The human mind simply cannot carry all the information without error so the record becomes part of your practice” (Larry Weed, 1971 - see &lt;a href=&quot;https://wardle.org/cis-design/2017/05/01/medical-record.html&quot;&gt;https://wardle.org/cis-design/2017/05/01/medical-record.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;effective-software-development&quot;&gt;Effective software development&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breast cancer data collection requirements potentially teach us a lot; the essence of those requirements has broad applicability to other diseases, whether cancer or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so important to have a strong vision for how we want the future to look, and how we want to enable data to drive patient care, service improvement and research, but there’s a paradox in technology, in that the best way to deliver technology is to break apart the big problems that you’re trying to solve and then &lt;em&gt;compose&lt;/em&gt; the solutions together again. We have to think big but work small and iterate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Composability is fundamental to the next generation of electronic health and record systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we also need to be sufficiently confident in our understanding of technology that we call out the hubris when someone provides an 18-month plan for how to deliver intangible benefits. We have to be able to stand up and say that this bit is a hard problem and we’ll need to explore different ways of solving that, and understand that we will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, working incrementally in the small is less risky than following an 18-month plan. Planning is good, but our plans will change and adapt as we learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s seductive to think otherwise, and pretty difficult to sell “we don’t know” as a tagline. Perhaps you don’t get appointed to a job if you say we “don’t have all of the answers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s a lot we do know, and one size doesn’t fit all in technology, whether we’re talking about approach, standards, ‘buy vs build’ (should we buy the solution to this problem off the shelf or build it ourselves?) or any other facet of ‘digital’, and so we need to see the fracture lines and break-apart our problem domain and get on with delivering appropriate solutions or starting the graft of learning how to solve problems in that domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to be &lt;em&gt;agile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;deliver-better-and-faster-by-doing-things-right&quot;&gt;Deliver better and faster by doing things right&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can speed up delivery of valuable digital tools and technology by adopting the right approach. We should stack the odds of being successful in our favour. There are many examples where will fail to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s return to breast cancer. What can we learn from this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Central reporting helps us understand what is important from policy-makers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data should be sourced from results of the processes of care.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Operational systems should focus on &lt;em&gt;meaningful data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to adopt a modular, de-coupled and agile approach to health and care software and data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not difficult to see the sources of information that we need for breast cancer reporting - demographic data links a patient with different identifiers across organisations, appointments and scheduling provides a virtual scaffold for the ‘when’ and ‘how’ things have happened via different pathways, laboratory and radiology data brought together help understand the pathology and its extent (staging), and finally, at MDT, we need tools to validate and refine those ‘inputs’, record the decision-making and plan the next steps in care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, those requirements for breast cancer are not much different for any other illness either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that tells us what we need to be building for the next generation of electronic health and care record systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how can we deliver a compelling and credible plan to build that technology that will underpin our ambitions for health and care in Wales?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National governance arrangements and technical architecture need to ensure that we reduce the need for constant coordination between different groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve failed if we need everyone ‘in the room’!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decouple and modularise, to permit parallel independent working at pace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use open technical standards to define the interfaces between modules&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;avoid single repositories and instead use shared vocabularies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;develop an unremitting focus on &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;foster greater use of off-the-shelf cloud providers and move to &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt; our infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;define clear lines of responsibility for different services, and include performance  and reliability metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Alfred North Whitehead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An Introduction to Mathematics (1911)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our job in digital health and care is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to use data as the foundation to our health and care services,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to understand how to modularise our computing and data services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in order to &lt;em&gt;compose&lt;/em&gt; those modules back together in interesting ways to solve problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should be designing with data and composable, modular, de-coupled, re-usable, stateless computing services that can act on those data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, they are the building blocks, the foundation stones of a pyramid. Each level of that pyramid reflects a higher-level of abstraction, providing more sophisticated solutions to our health and care problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the lowest levels are the core foundational services such as patient identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the highest levels, we will be solving our most nefarious problems, and not thinking about the low-level abstractions we already have in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, a value set is a set of values that can be used for a data field. It is a vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many health interoperability technologies leave value sets as something to be &lt;em&gt;profiled&lt;/em&gt;. This means that one actually can’t exchange meaningful information unless you agree on what you are using for a particular field. In many cases that means you can talk, but you’re both talking different languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often value sets model real-world operations very closely. Sometimes, they don’t because
they reflect central reporting requirements and act as a classification system rather than a terminology. You can learn a lot by asking yourself who is the primary user of that value set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to think of this, in a non-technical manner, is that for central reporting we might want to categorise a clinical encounter by main specialty (e.g. neurology), but in fact the patient was really seen by a number of different specialties or clinicians in subspecialty practice (e.g. epilepsy surgery pre-assessment clinic). The reporting is important, but it is a prism through which we view the record in order to simplify our analytics. It isn’t the “truth”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious that a flat classification system is great for reporting, because you categorise patients into groups, but an ontology does much more. Ontologies not only provides value lists but provides information about how each value relates to one another. For example,  paediatric neurology &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is-a&lt;/code&gt; paediatric speciality, paediatric neurology &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is-a&lt;/code&gt; neurology specialty). That makes ontologies much better for operational clinical systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s seductive to use an information standard for operational systems (“we’ve used a standard”), and sometimes that’s the right approach. More often, it’s much better to define the value set in terms of an ontology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logical consequence is that we need systems that can transparently flip between different classification and ontology systems. When we can do that with losing information, it is called ‘round-tripping’, but in many cases it’s not possible to map without losing information because a classification simply doesn’t have the necessary level of granularity. The logical consequence of that is that we should do most of our work in a finely-grained terminology that has an ontological basis and map to less granular, lossy classification schemes for reporting purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any national data project in health and care needs to give careful consideration to how to process data. In general, real-life health and care data is granular, hierarchical, graph-like and complex, while many central reporting requirements prefer a simpler tabular, categorised view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example here using real code, in Clojure, to demonstrate how we can build stable, reliable clinical systems that can seamlessly switch between ontological value sets and classification value sets, and sometimes back again. This example uses a value set that is useful both for reporting and operationally: triage category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve deliberately chosen this as we can round-trip without losing information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my real-time write up of coding some simple logic to handle mapping between different value sets. I wrote it in the space of an afternoon, so it’s only a demonstration. The code is trivial - 32 lines of actual code. The declarative data definitions and maps are the important thing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s written in Clojure, a lisp than runs on the Java virtual machine (JVM). It makes it very easy to do coding in an exploratory way. This is my first live-coding blog in Clojure. It’s an experiment to show how easy it is to map between identifiers if we have our classifications published in a machine readable format with appropriate namespacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;com.eldrix.janus.standards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-worked-example-triage-category&quot;&gt;A worked example: triage category&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s our NHS Wales information standards data from the emergency department dataset. It should be a goal for us to publish datasets like this in a format that can be read by machines but that’s not available, so I’ve created a machine-readable version here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It defines a value set for triage categories, representing the patient’s priority in an emergency system at time of triage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I’ve added a namespace. This means that the combination of namespace and value is globally unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One job for data standards is to define publicly accessible namespaces and their values.
This means that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage|02&lt;/code&gt; will be “very urgent”. It’s impossible to process the code “02” by itself - you have to have insider knowledge of a table structure and what it means. Namespacing codes means that they can standalone and be interpreted appropriately. I’ve made up that namespace - but these need to be published well-known namespaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;These are the NHS Wales data dictionary datasets. 
  See http://www.datadictionary.wales.nhs.uk
  Ideally these should be imported from a machine-readable source, 
  but that doesn't yet exist&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

                             &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;06&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;See and Treat&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]}}}})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fragment of the larger dataset, and only includes the triage categories. The code below works for other defined categories in other datasets within the NHS Wales information standards catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that I’ve included a map to SNOMED CT for each category. There isn’t an equivalent for “See and treat” so we need to raise this with SNOMED International. (It is also where NHS Wales diverges in its standard from NHS England).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need some helper functions to process these information. You don’t need to understand how these work. Skip if you can’t read lisp! This is a toy implementation just to show the logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clojure allows arbitrary structures to be used as keys and values in associative arrays (also called dictionaries or hash-maps). This means I use tuples here as a key to permit toy lookup functionality. This doesn’t provide real ontological inference - only providing equivalence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;defn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;categories-&amp;gt;ns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Convert a list of categories into namespaced identifiers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;hash-map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))))))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;defn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;all-identifiers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;defn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reg-equiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Register that the specified identifiers, expressed as {:system :value}
  are equivalent, symmetrically&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reg-equiv-asymm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reg-equiv-asymm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we can process our machine-readable dataset, and simply register that one identifier from one classification or terminology is equivalent to another. Let’s do that now for our triage category. In a real production system, we’d use a service that provided an abstract ontological service and could provide an inference engine off-the-shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;defn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reg-datasets-snomed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Register SNOMED maps for the value sets (categories) from the items 
  in the datasets&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;doall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;all-identifiers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reg-equiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://snomed.info/sct&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:info.snomed/sct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)})))))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve registered a symmetric map between SNOMED CT and the dataset definitions from the NHS Wales information standards. Real ontologies provide many more options to define relationships between identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s double check that this works by round-tripping between our triage identifier and SNOMED CT and back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reg-datasets-snomed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get-in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;registry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;05&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://snomed.info/sct&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;;-&amp;gt; returns =&amp;gt; {:system &quot;https://snomed.info/sct&quot;, :value 1077251000000100}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get-in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;registry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://snomed.info/sct&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1077251000000100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; -&amp;gt; returns =&amp;gt; {:system &quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage&quot;, :value &quot;05&quot;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means we can build an ‘alias’ system, taking arbitrary collections of identifiers and expanding/denormalising into all of the registered codesystems we know. In a real implementation, we’d recursively expand identifiers so we could alias all equivalent identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;defn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expand-identifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Determine the equivalent identifiers for the specified identifier tuple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;hash-map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;flatten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; 
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;conj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;vals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;registry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s check it works. Here we expand a single identifier tuple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;expand-identifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;05&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;;  =&amp;gt; {&quot;https://snomed.info/sct&quot; 1077251000000100, &quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage&quot; &quot;05&quot;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we can send in arbitrary identifiers which will be ignored if there are no expansions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;This won't be mapped&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;05&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/other&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;N/A&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expand-identifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; =&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;{&quot;https://snomed.info/sct&quot; 1077251000000100,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; :name &quot;This won't be mapped&quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; &quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage&quot; &quot;05&quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; &quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/other&quot; &quot;N/A&quot;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can use these functions to build maps between arbitrary value sets in both classification and terminology systems - we could add an arbitrary map to another terminology or classification&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-about-hl7-fhir-and-openehr&quot;&gt;What about HL7 FHIR and openEHR?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But look! We have triage models defined by both HL7 FHIR and openEHR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach is to try to centralise all of the definitions in one place. That’s a seductive approach, but brittle and difficult to change. It makes it harder in the future because you need a central authority to manage and curate. It’s much better to built a dynamic registry to which multiple code systems can register independently. It’s important to decouple at a technical level. That registry could be a small microservice that provides identifier mapping, semantics and inference, but that registrations at that registry can be made by multiple teams who don’t necessarily need to coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An openEHR triage archetype is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/archetypes/1013.1.304&quot;&gt;https://ckm.openehr.org/ckm/archetypes/1013.1.304&lt;/a&gt; but the data item is free-text! So much for semantic interoperability! This archetype is no good for our purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, openEHR could support defining a value set either internally, or using a codeable concept. But this illustrates an important problem of openEHR; you still need to agree on a set of archetypes that will be used across your organisations and software systems if you are going to have semantic interoperability. It isn’t a magic bullet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HL7 FHIR categories are &lt;a href=&quot;https://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/v3/ActPriority/vs.html&quot;&gt;https://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/v3/ActPriority/vs.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about both openEHR and HL7 FHIR is that we can get definitions in machine-readable formats. We can therefore write tools that import and register those value-sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HL7 FHIR value set is defined under the namespace &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-ActPriority&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this simple proof-of-concept, let’s register the equivalence of the semantics manually. In a real-life application, we’d download the HL7 FHIR definitions in machine-readable formats and process accordingly in our inference engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reg-equiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActPriority&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;UR&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;03&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that means we can take FHIR identifiers and turn them into what we need. Notice we turn a FHIR ‘UR’ code into an NHS Wales emergency triage “03” code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;expand-identifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActPriority&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;UR&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; =&amp;gt; {&quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage&quot; &quot;03&quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;;     &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActPriority&quot; &quot;UR&quot;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do it in reverse as part of a collection of different identifiers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-clojure highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;:name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;                                                  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;This won't be mapped&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;03&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/other&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;N/A&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expand-identifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;; =&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;;{&quot;https://snomed.info/sct&quot; 1064901000000108,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; :name &quot;This won't be mapped&quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; &quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/triage&quot; &quot;03&quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActPriority&quot; &quot;UR&quot;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;; &quot;https://data.standards.cymru/Id/datasets/edss/other&quot; &quot;N/A&quot;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that means we can now do logic such as asking, was this an urgent category and it doesn’t matter whether the information is encoded in SNOMED CT, the NHS Wales information standard or HL7 FHIR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be no surprise that we can do the same for cross-border interoperability. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/data_dictionary/attributes/a/a_and_e_initial_assessment_triage_category_de.asp?shownav=1&quot;&gt;NHS England data dictionary&lt;/a&gt; has the same triage categories, except code “06” (See and Treat). We can either work to share definitions and therefore share the same namespace, or instead provide a declarative map from which the logic of mapping can be encoded and used by machines. If the namespace is shared, then coordination will be necessary so that “06” isn’t accidentally re-used for a semantically different triage category. If different namespaces are used, no coordination would be necessary except in tracking a declarative map from one to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve built mapping between SNOMED CT, ICD-10, Read codes and other codesystems in my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wardle/go-terminology&quot;&gt;terminology server, written in golang&lt;/a&gt;. My real version of the Janus tool uses that to drive inferential logic using SNOMED as the lingua franca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next step is to explore the use of off-the-shelf ontology tools to see whether they have the right performance and scaling characteristics to handle such a large ontology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For NHS Wales, we need to publish our information standards in machine-readable formats, adopt namespaces for our value sets and publish maps to those classifications from operational terminology systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;learning-points&quot;&gt;Learning points:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to namespace identifiers used for central reporting to give them &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to publish datasets and category definitions in machine-readable formats so that they can be processed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to publish a declarative mapping from one identifier namespace to another if we wish to foster semantic interoperability; an ontology of ontologies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clojure (and other lisps) are really nice for doing exploratory programming using data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote it in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the statistics as of 24th June 2020:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 34,587 registered patients from across Wales, with 36% living Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, 15.9% Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, 11.3% Swansea Bay Health Board, 7.5% Cwm Taf University Health Board and the remaining distributed across Hywel Dda, Betsi Cadwaladr, Powys University Health Boards and NHS England sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 111 defined patient cohorts, with 78 NHS cohorts and 32 research cohorts and 577 health professionals registered to use the system including 81 specialist nurses, 78 administrators, 75 consultants, 63 physiotherapists, 52 doctors-in-training, 34 speech and language therapists, 30 occupational therapists, 25 dieticians and 10 psychologists, with the remaining comprising research associates, administrators and students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been 436,145 clinical encounters recorded using the software with usage increasing during the COVID-19 crisis to record patient clinical and research contacts. Of these, there have been 175,144 telephone calls, 116,977 outpatient clinic assessments, 91,854 virtual encounters, 17,504 home visits,  11,234 inpatient encounters, 7639 multi-disciplinary team assessments and 5891 therapy group encounters. There are 4843 electronic consent forms recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It integrates with the NHS Wales enterprise master patient index, the NHS Wales Care Record Service, the Cardiff and Vale document repository, the staff directory, multiple patient administrative systems and uses NHS systems for staff authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is founded on structured meaningful data. All patients have a list of addresses and each address is mapped to health organisation and LSOA and so from there, indices of deprivation. Each patient has a list of diagnoses and problems and treatments. Each patient is linked to multiple health boards but users don’t think in terms of organisations, only services, which can span multiple health and care organisations. At any time, we can view disease progression, by whatever outcome measure, against a cohort of patients with the same disease or defined by other shared characteristics such as age, gender, age at onset etc. It was easy to identify all of our patients with, for example, motor neurone disease, who might need to ‘shield’ from COVID-19; a three-click operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 6000 clinical or research encounters are recorded each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m re-building it, there’s a lot I’m doing differently but the fundamentals stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data data data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declarative programming with rule-engine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean architecture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Separation of concerns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decoupling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have been the characteristics of these successes? They have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;focused on delivering solutions to immediate needs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;broken down historic barriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;used commodity cloud services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leveraged commodity technologies such as video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s really important to recognise this good work but we also need to see that most of this work has been, what are essentially, greenfield developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that tells you something interesting, because if you enable a culture, and a technology platform, that allows things to be developed as independently as possible - &lt;em&gt;decoupling&lt;/em&gt;, then it’s like giving a nitro-boost to your digital productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next challenge is to see how we can use those same approaches for brownfield developments, paying down technical debt and re-focusing our technical architecture on data and standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a paradox here. People who know little about technology and software think it makes sense to centralise and manage through command and control. It’s a seductive approach, but it doesn’t work. Let’s do it “once-for-Wales” they say, as if technology wasn’t a complex, multi-faceted intervention in a complex adaptive system. One size truly doesn’t fit all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;transparency&quot;&gt;Transparency&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my biggest concern?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That while here in Wales we have an amazing mix of people, skills and capabilities, we’re not working as openly and transparently as we should, and we’re not fostering healthy discussion and debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work for the public sector, and that means being open and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wales can and should be the best place to do health and care technology. But late in 2018, at a national clinical informatics meeting, I was told that I could no longer work for the NHS Wales Informatics Service unless I took down this blog, because it was deemed critical of the status quo (*).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be critical because we need to keep on improving for the people of Wales, and having insight into when we’re doing well and when we’re not, is critical in order to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in light of that, while the NHS Wales Technical Standards Board has been furloughed, albeit temporarily, have a look at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/nhscymru/projects&quot;&gt;project list&lt;/a&gt; and raise &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nhscymru/standards/issues&quot;&gt;an issue&lt;/a&gt;, and start a debate. The website is open. Its source code is open. Anyone can contribute. Tell me, what should we be doing next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(*) I no longer work for the NHS Wales Informatics Service. The “funding ran out”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">There has been some really good work in digital health and care in response to the COVID-19 crisis in Wales.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Complexity and abstraction</title><link href="https://www.wardle.org/strategy/2020/06/23/complexity.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Complexity and abstraction" /><published>2020-06-23T10:09:09+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-23T10:09:09+01:00</updated><id>https://www.wardle.org/strategy/2020/06/23/complexity</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.wardle.org/strategy/2020/06/23/complexity.html">&lt;p&gt;Complexity in health and care software derives from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the inherent complexity of the domain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;legacy software and legacy architecture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;organisation-centricity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who is paying and procurement rules around those payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re trying to solve problems in health and care, a large part of the work is actually in dealing with complexity that we’ve inherited; it is complexity largely of our own making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common way to managing complexity is the process of &lt;em&gt;abstraction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about time that we had a compelling developer platform that abstracted some of the complexity of health and care data and services so that we can focus on managing the complexity of our domain: health and care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why platform-thinking is fundamental to building the next generation of health and care software. We need to “do the hard work to make it simple.”&lt;/p&gt;

Information standards are very important in ensuring organisations feed the right information back in the right format so that the data are interpretable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a data set is the emergency unit data set ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/emergency-care-data-set-ecds&quot;&gt;NHS England&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datadictionary.wales.nhs.uk/#!WordDocuments/emergencydepartmentdatasetedds.htm&quot;&gt;NHS Wales&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All organisations are expected to return data on attendances at the emergency department including diagnostic category, level of triage (urgency) and onward destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a similar requirement for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datadictionary.wales.nhs.uk/index.html#!WordDocuments/outpatientdatasetopds.htm&quot;&gt;outpatient clinics.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing the format of the data to be returned, how it is to be coded and how and when to return data are all important but there are also rules and definitions which must be followed. That’s the job of information standards and therefore, historically, the principal customer of information standards has been central data reporting. Those users have requested standards, they’re discussed and then set, usually by publishing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nwisinformationstandards.wales.nhs.uk/data-set-change-notices.&quot;&gt;‘data standards change notice’&lt;/a&gt;. A new government policy or a problem affecting policy teams results in a new requirement for data reporting with either a new information standard or an update to an existing standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see the consequences in clinical practice. There are byzantine rules relating to my outpatient clinics to which I am only dimly aware and forms to fill in that have little to do with the patient in front of me and everything to do with the requirements of the wider system. They’re important, but they’re but one facet of the clinical encounter. In many situations there is considerable overlap with the needs of direct care and that of management, at least semantically, but sometimes the categories are simply too coarse or the rules don’t keep up with change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this is from the outpatient dataset definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“
	An appointment cannot be counted unless the patient actually attends
“
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datadictionary.wales.nhs.uk/index.html#!WordDocuments/outpatientattendances.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.datadictionary.wales.nhs.uk/index.html#!WordDocuments/outpatientattendances.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what has happened to the telephone appointments I’ve done for years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, fortunately, an update has been made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nwisinformationstandards.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/documents/299/20200206%2DDSCN%202020%2001%2DOutpatient%20Virtual%20Activity%2DPhase%20One%2Dv1%2D1.pdf&quot;&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt; so that virtual reviews are now part of the submission, with three categories - ‘face-to-face’, ‘virtual with patient contact’, and ‘virtual with no patient contact’. Information technology teams will be adding these data fields to administrative systems so that these returns can be made in this altered form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central data requirements are important and valuable in running the wider health system but it is commonly the case that those requirements define the operational requirements and design of clinical systems instead of being recognised as simply another prism through which to view the patient record. It’s important when designing clinical systems to understand the uses of data, for all needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The the main issues with central data requirements as the basis to build clinical software are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they tend to result in the use of classification systems; using taxonomies makes it easier to perform analysis but they are a poor fit for the ambiguity and complexity of the real world&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they use bespoke, proprietary value-sets limiting semantic interoperability if they are used&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they can end up defining operational system data requirements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they usually expect tabular data to make it easier to analyse but health and care data is rarely tabular. Patients have more than one diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the rules for central data propagate into clinical systems creating brittleness; it makes changing those rules difficult and skews our ability to use historic data acquired using different rules. How we analyse outpatient attendances over time will be difficult if telephone appointments were not returned before 2020?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the brittleness and lack of adaptability infects other systems that need to interoperate, because without ontological defined value lists, its very difficult indeed to consume data from other systems without constant discussion between the teams that run different systems, creating coupling and reducing our ability to develop software-at-pace in parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to these issues are simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need clinical data that is granular and specific and that models the real-world and adapts to how it changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we should use ontologies and not taxonomies for data capture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we need tools to turn granular, specific data into categorical, easy-to-process data for central returns, policy-makers and other analytics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we should apply rules and delay losing granularity as late as possible in our analytics, and apply them dynamically and declaratively while categorising data flexibly in response to changing requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;specialty-codes&quot;&gt;Specialty codes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that a clinical system use a list of specialties using the “standard” as defined for reporting purposes, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datadictionary.wales.nhs.uk/index.html#!WordDocuments/mainspecialtyconsultant.htm&quot;&gt;“main specialty” (it used to be called the ‘treatment function code’)&lt;/a&gt;. That’s attractive, because that part of our data won’t need any transformation in order to submit those data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about our clinical users? We’d like to help them find the information that they want, at the right time, and that means providing them tools to search perhaps thousands of clinical documents. While coding specialty to the &lt;em&gt;reporting&lt;/em&gt; standard is better than free text, we’re losing granularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the use of an ontology, such as SNOMED CT, can solve our many needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For clinical users, using an ontology means we can filter for ‘neurology’ and show ‘neurology’ letters and also ‘paediatric neurology’, while the latter will also show up in our ‘paediatric’ filter, because the ontology is more than a list of codes, as it represents the &lt;em&gt;relationships&lt;/em&gt; between those codes. Our software can use those declared relationships to extract meaning from codes, even for codes that didn’t exist when that software was written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we can exchange information with other systems that do not keep up with the DSCN and we don’t need to keep orchestrating updates to the ‘fixed’ specialty list across all components, whether developed in-house or provided by third-parties, because using an ontology provides dynamism and adaptability. I can write software now that can process specialty codes not defined at the time I wrote the code.  We create the right conditions to decouple our systems and create inherent flexibility and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decoupling is important. It may be that a new departmental system already supports the DSCN; after all the list is defined legally by the General and Specialist Medical Practice (Education, Training and Qualifications) Order 2003 and European Primary and Specialist Dental Qualifications Regulations 1998, but if not, that commercial partner will need to implement those codes. It can make procurement more difficult and more costly and fossilises the interactions between systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-single-patient-record&quot;&gt;The single patient record.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our aspiration should be the single patient record, a multifaceted longitudinal structured record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/prisms-record.png&quot; alt=&quot;Prisms Record&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must be clear that such a record can be used for a variety of purposes such as direct care, service management and improvement as well as research with the appropriate consent. The best way to design such a record is using highly granular, clinically-meaningful approach to data modelling based on open standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think it’s a very good idea to imagine multiple prisms through which we can see and understand that record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those prisms are dependent on your processes, workflow and needs. A patient viewing their own record needs a different prism than a civil servant modelling future emergency unit attendances. We should be annotating the results of investigation or groups of investigations with our clinical interpretation in the context of the problem at hand, just like we do via a letter at the moment. That data will need to be prioritised within the patient prism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a radiographer about to perform an MRI scan needs a different prism than a neurologist in a video consultation with a patient and family members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same data, different prisms. Different focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, I hope that adaptable focus will help me identify what’s important and what’s not, but for now, ask any professional and they’ll tell you what’s the critical information they need in a given context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s always more than one side to every story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what&quot;&gt;So what?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s why we need data and tools that make it easy to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Model the real world, capturing granular, specific, meaningful information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn such granular information into categorical information for ease of analytics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resolve, infer meaning from and map identifiers between different systems, classifications and ontologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I’ve been building open-source software to solve these problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wardle/go-terminology&quot;&gt;go-terminology&lt;/a&gt; : If I make a diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), I need my clinical system to record that specific granular diagnosis but I also need tools need to be able to categorise that diagnosis without manual intervention for service level analytics. go-terminology provides both of those capabilities using SNOMED-CT, an ontology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;janus : a data-driven dynamic identifier resolution and mapping application programming interface / knowledge graph navigator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wardle/concierge&quot;&gt;concierge&lt;/a&gt; : a backend to identifier resolution and mapping services providing integration and abstractions with multiple NHS Wales services including multiple patient administrative systems, the national enterprise master patient index, the staff directory, staff authentication services and document repositories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wardle/clods&quot;&gt;clods&lt;/a&gt; : a backend identifier resolution/mapping service for UK NHS organisational data services and other reference data including the NHS postcode database and general practitioners across the UK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these services can dynamically resolve and map between different identifier systems helping software (and humans) ‘make sense’ of health and care data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s why I’ve been advocating this approach within health and care in Wales for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPS. When will clinical systems build a source of open data relating to how users interact with their software in a given context in a given patient with the problems, past and scheduled events, medication known in order to learn the &lt;em&gt;information value&lt;/em&gt; of our health and care data for decision-making? That kind of learning is just another prism, of course.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Historically, data capture in health and care has been driven by the requirements of central data returns, permitting management and government to examine and monitor a specific health policy area.
